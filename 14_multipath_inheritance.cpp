// Using virtual inheritance to avoid ambiguity
// when multiple paths lead to the same base class
// This is useful in hybrid inheritance scenarios where multiple paths lead to the same base class.
// It ensures that only one instance of the base class is created, preventing ambiguity and redundancy.
// It helps to maintain a single instance of the base class, reducing memory usage and potential conflicts in member access.
// It is important to note that virtual inheritance can introduce some complexity in the class hierarchy and may require careful design to avoid issues such as the diamond problem, where a derived class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common base class.
// In such cases, virtual inheritance can help to resolve ambiguity and ensure that the derived class has a single instance of the base class.

// example 
// base class A
// class B ans class C both inherit from A
// and class D inherits from both B and C

// Why ambiguous?
// Because D inherits two copies of A: one through B, one through C. So the compiler doesn't know which

//Only create one shared copy of this base class, even if itâ€™s inherited along multiple paths

// In virtual inheritance, only one copy of the base class (e.g. A) is created,
//         and the intermediate classes (e.g. B and C) point to that shared copy.



// without virtual inheritance:
//                    A        A 
//                    â†‘        â†‘
//                    B        C     this is why ambiguous
//                     \      /      this is the diamond shape
//                      \    /
//                        D          Because D inherits two copies of A: one through B, one through C. So the compiler doesn't know which

// with virtual inheritance:
//                        A
//                      â†—   â†–            B and C both point to the same A
//                     B      C          âœ… D has one shared A, no ambiguity
//                      \    /
//                         D



//     in virtual inheritance, the derived classes (B and C) do not contain their own full copies of the base class (A), 
//     but instead they effectively hold a reference or pointer to a shared instance of A.


//      Ambiguity 
//      Ambiguity in C++ refers to a situation where the compiler cannot determine which class member (function or variable) to use 
//      because multiple candidates are accessible with the same name, and there's no clear resolution.


//     ðŸ§  In Simple Terms:
//     Ambiguity occurs when the compiler is confused about which version of a function or variable you're trying to access.



//    Ambiguity = Compiler confusion due to multiple matching choices with no clear preference.
